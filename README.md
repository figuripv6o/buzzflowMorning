⚙️ Config: config/routine.yml

You can change your routine without touching the script.

Examples of things you can configure:

Wake-up affirmation

Prayer / meditation line

Study block (e.g., “long & hard study session: Cybersecurity x Real Estate”)

Workout / movement

Night recap


Update the YAML and the script will reflect it.

🧠 Daily Flow (Example)

1. GM Prayer – quick gratitude + protection.


2. Mind Check – one sentence about how you feel.


3. BuzzFlow Block – most important task (study / legal / build).


4. Movement – even 5–10 minutes.


5. Night Review – what got done, what carries over.



Keep it simple. Keep it consistent.
Discipline > motivation.
